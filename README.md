## Project Structure

Your project directory should look like this:

```
pet-sound-detection/
├── audio_files/             # Directory containing audio files
│   ├── bark_1.wav
│   ├── bark_2.wav
│   ├── meow_1.wav
│   └── meow_2.wav
├── data.csv                 # CSV file mapping audio files to labels
├── extract_features.py       # Script for feature extraction from audio files
├── train_model.py            # Script to train the model
├── predict.py                # Script to make predictions using the trained model
├── pet_sound_detection_model.h5  # Saved trained model
└── label_encoder.pkl         # Saved label encoder
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd pet-sound-detection
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv pet-sound-detection-env
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     source pet-sound-detection-env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     pet-sound-detection-env\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preparation

1. **Organize Your Audio Files**:
   Place your audio files in the `audio_files/` directory. The audio files should be in `.wav` format.

2. **Create the CSV File**:
   Create a file named `data.csv` in the project root with the following format:
   ```csv
   filename,label
   audio_files/bark_1.wav,bark
   audio_files/bark_2.wav,bark
   audio_files/meow_1.wav,meow
   audio_files/meow_2.wav,meow
   ```

## Feature Extraction

To extract features from the audio files, run the following command:

```bash
python extract_features.py
```

This will create two NumPy files: `features.npy` and `labels.npy`.

## Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will train the model using the extracted features and save the trained model as `pet_sound_detection_model.h5` and the label encoder as `label_encoder.pkl`.

## Making Predictions

To make predictions using the trained model, update the `test_file` variable in `predict.py` to point to the audio file you want to test, and then run:

```bash
python predict.py
```

The predicted label for the specified audio file will be printed in the console.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, you can modify the `evaluate_model` function in `predict.py` to check the accuracy against a set of known labels.

Add the following function to `predict.py`:

```python
def evaluate_model(test_files, true_labels):
    correct_predictions = 0
    total_files = len(test_files)

    for file, true_label in zip(test_files, true_labels):
        predicted_label = predict_sound(file)[0]
        if predicted_label == true_label:
            correct_predictions += 1

    accuracy = correct_predictions / total_files
    print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

You can then call this function with a list of test files and their true labels.
